# CARTIGO

CARTIGO is a feature-rich e-commerce website built using modern frontend technologies. The site offers a seamless shopping experience with intuitive navigation, dynamic product listings, and efficient state management.

## Features

1. **Responsive Design**: The website layout is designed for consistency and compatibility across various screen sizes. A JavaScript-based hamburger menu ensures intuitive navigation on medium and small screens.

2. **Dynamic Product Integration**: Products are dynamically integrated into the website using React and API calls, ensuring that the product listings are always up-to-date. Users can effortlessly add or remove products from their cart, with the total amount updating dynamically as changes are made.

3. **Product Filtering**: The site includes filtering options based on categories, allowing users to streamline their shopping experience and easily find the products they are looking for.

4. **Single-Page Application**: With routing implemented via React Router, CARTIGO transforms into a single-page web application. This ensures seamless navigation between pages and an enhanced user experience without the need for full page reloads.

5. **State Management with Redux**: Redux is used for efficient state management, ensuring smooth data flow and a consistent state across the application. This enhances the overall performance and user experience.
